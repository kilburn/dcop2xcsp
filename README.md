# USC-DCOP to XCSP problem converter

This project converts problems between the (USC DCOP Repository format)[http://teamcore.usc.edu/dcop/] and the (Frodo2 XCSP format)[http://thomas.leaute.name/frodo/manual/FRODO_User_Manual.html].

This is useful to test algorithms on the same problems, even if they are implemented in different solvers.
